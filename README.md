# Data Structures

Working with Data Structures in Java

I personally absolutely love working with data structures. They are fun to work with. You can literally feel objects being passed around,
placed into appropriate slots in the data structure and sitting there, ready for you to work with.

My three favorite data structures in the Collection framework:
1. HashMap - by far my favorite. Key-Value pairing closely resembles your typical relational database structure with Primary Keys
2. ArrayList - best array available in the Collection, dynamic, quick, light. What more can you want from an array?
3. LinkedList - fun to work with, easy to pop and pull, add and remove elements. If you need a structure to add/remove elements a lot - this is it

This little app is here to show I understand Data Structures and how to work with them. How to create them, how to place objects inside,
how to find objects inside, and get their values, etc. Also, wanted to show I can create datastructure of datastructures, like HashMap of HashMaps.

Thanks for checking it out!

Have a great day
